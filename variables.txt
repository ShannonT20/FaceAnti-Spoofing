Face Spoofing Detection Challenge - Variable Descriptions
================================================================================

CSV Files:
----------

1. train.csv
   - image_id: Unique identifier for each training image
   - filename: Name of the image file
   - label: Ground truth label (0=Real face, 1=Fake/Spoofed face)

2. validation.csv
   - image_id: Unique identifier for each validation image (image_01, image_02, ..., image_723)
   - filename: Name of the image file (image_01.jpg, image_02.jpg, etc.)
   - Note: Labels are NOT provided in this file. Use this to generate predictions for ranking.
   - Note: This is used for ranking submissions. DO NOT use for training.

3. test.csv
   - image_id: Unique identifier for each test image
   - filename: Name of the image file
   - Note: Labels are not provided. Use this to generate predictions.

4. reference.csv
   - image_id: Unique identifier for validation images (image_01, image_02, ..., image_723)
   - label: Ground truth label (real=Real face, fake=Fake/Spoofed face)
   - Note: This file is ONLY for organizers/evaluators. Participants should NOT use or access this file.
   - Note: Organizers use this to evaluate participant submissions on validation data.

5. sample_submission.csv
   - image_id: Unique identifier for validation images (image_01, image_02, ..., image_723)
   - real: Probability of being a real face (0.0 to 1.0)
   - fake: Probability of being a fake/spoofed face (0.0 to 1.0)
   - Note: This is the template for submission format. real + fake = 1.0 for each prediction
   - Note: Replace with your model's probability predictions

Data Structure:
--------------
- Each image has a corresponding color (RGB) and depth (grayscale) version
- Color images: face_spoofing_data/train_img/train_img/color/
- Depth images: face_spoofing_data/train_img/train_img/depth/
- Validation images: face_spoofing_data/val_img/val_img/color/ and depth/
- Validation images are named sequentially: image_01.jpg, image_02.jpg, ..., image_723.jpg

Labels:
-------
- real: Real face (authentic)
- fake: Fake face (spoofed - printed photo, video replay, mask, etc.)
- Note: In train.csv and validation.csv, labels are "real" or "fake". For model training, convert to 0 (real) or 1 (fake).

Evaluation:
-----------
- Use train.csv for training your model
- Use validation.csv to generate predictions (labels NOT provided - you predict them!)
- Submit your predictions on validation.csv in the submission format for ranking
- Organizers will evaluate your predictions using reference.csv (which you don't have access to)
- Generate predictions for test.csv and submit as sample_submission.csv format
- Do NOT use validation.csv for training (this would cause data leakage)

Submission Format:
-----------------
Your submission CSV should have:
- image_id: Image identifier from validation.csv (image_01, image_02, etc.)
- real: Probability of being a real face (0.0 to 1.0)
- fake: Probability of being a fake face (0.0 to 1.0)
- Note: real + fake must equal 1.0 for each prediction
- Same order as sample_submission.csv
- Format: image_id,real,fake
