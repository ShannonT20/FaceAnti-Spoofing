Face Spoofing Detection Challenge - Variable Descriptions
================================================================================

CSV Files:
----------

1. train.csv
   - image_id: Unique identifier for each training image (actual filename without extension)
   - filename: Name of the image file (e.g., 10_1.avi_100_real.jpg)
   - label: Ground truth label (0=Real face, 1=Fake/Spoofed face)
   - Total: 2017 training images
   - Location: face_spoofing_data/train_img/train_img/color/

2. validation.csv
   - image_id: Unique identifier for each validation image (actual filename without extension, e.g., 10_1.avi_100_real)
   - filename: Name of the image file (e.g., 10_1.avi_100_real.jpg)
   - Note: Labels are NOT provided in this file. Use this to generate predictions for ranking.
   - Note: This is used for ranking submissions. DO NOT use for training.
   - Total: 505 validation images
   - Location: face_spoofing_data/val_img/val_img/color/

3. test.csv
   - image_id: Unique identifier for each test image (image_01, image_02, ..., image_654)
   - filename: Name of the image file (image_01.jpg, image_02.jpg, etc.)
   - Note: Labels are NOT provided. Use this to generate predictions.
   - Note: This is used for final evaluation. DO NOT use for training.
   - Total: 620 test images
   - Location: face_spoofing_data/test_img/test_img/color/


5. sample_submission.csv
   - image_id: Unique identifier for test images (image_01, image_02, ..., image_654)
   - real: Probability of being a real face (0.0 to 1.0)
   - fake: Probability of being a fake/spoofed face (0.0 to 1.0)
   - Note: This is the template for submission format. real + fake = 1.0 for each prediction
   - Note: Replace with your model's probability predictions
   - Note: Must match test.csv image_ids and order

Data Structure:
--------------
- Each image has a corresponding color (RGB) and depth (grayscale) version
- Training images: face_spoofing_data/train_img/train_img/color/ and depth/
- Validation images: face_spoofing_data/val_img/val_img/color/ and depth/
- Test images: face_spoofing_data/test_img/test_img/color/ and depth/
- Validation CSV uses actual filenames as image_id (not sequential numbering)
- Test CSV uses sequential IDs: image_01, image_02, ..., image_654

Labels:
-------
- real: Real face (authentic)
- fake: Fake face (spoofed - printed photo, video replay, mask, etc.)
- Note: In train.csv, labels are 0 (real) or 1 (fake)
- Note: In reference.csv, labels are "real" or "fake"
- Note: For model training, convert to 0 (real) or 1 (fake) as needed

Evaluation:
-----------
- Use train.csv for training your model (2017 images with labels)
- Use validation.csv to generate predictions (505 images, labels NOT provided - you predict them!)
- Submit your predictions on validation.csv in the submission format for ranking
- Generate predictions for test.csv (620 images, labels NOT provided)
- Submit test predictions in sample_submission.csv format
- Organizers will evaluate your test predictions using reference.csv (which you don't have access to)
- Do NOT use validation.csv or test.csv for training (this would cause data leakage)

Submission Format:
-----------------
Your submission CSV should have:
- image_id: Image identifier from test.csv (image_01, image_02, ..., image_654)
- real: Probability of being a real face (0.0 to 1.0)
- fake: Probability of being a fake face (0.0 to 1.0)
- Note: real + fake must equal 1.0 for each prediction
- Same order as test.csv
- Format: image_id,real,fake

Data Statistics:
---------------
- Training images: 2017 (with labels)
- Validation images: 505 (no labels - for submission ranking)
- Test images: 620 (no labels - for final evaluation)
- Reference labels: 620 (486 real, 134 fake - for organizers only)
